## Introduction

[Boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) is a unit of writing that can be reused over and over without change. By extension, the idea is sometimes applied to reusable programming, as in “boilerplate code.”

## Difference between a boilerplate and a template

Boilerplate is something that you copy and paste and just add to a document. It comes up most often in contracts where language is used and reused, spelling out things like conditions and caveats.

Writers use templates as models, sometimes with negative effects. In broad terms, a template is a model or pattern used to create new objects. In writing, it is a standardized form of something like a resume that writers can use to flesh out their own versions.

Unlike boilerplates, templates are adapted for a particular use. The problem arose for me when students used Word templates for their resumes, and they all ended up looking the same.
